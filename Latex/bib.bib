	abstract = {he reduced basis (RB) methods are proposed here for the  solution of parametrized equations in linear elasticity  problems. The fundamental idea underlying RB methods is to  decouple the generation and projection stages  (offline/online computational procedures) of the  approximation process in order to solve parametrized  equations in a rapid, inexpensive and reliable way. The  method allows important computational savings with respect  to the classical Galerkin-finite element method, ill suited  to a repetitive environment like the parametrized contexts  of optimization, many queries and sensitivity analysis. We  consider different parametrization for the systems: either  physical quantities --to model the materials and loads--  and geometrical parameters --to model different geometrical  configurations--. Then we describe three different  applications of the method in problems with isotropic and  orthotropic materials working in plane stress and plane  strain approximation and subject to harmonic loads.},
